# Apple Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning and Regression Methods

![Stock Prediction](https://githubusercontent.com/AHMEDNUSARI/Dataguess_TeknolojiTask/main/StockImage.webp)
## üìå Overview
This project was developed as part of an assessment task assigned by Dataguess Teknoloji. The objective is to build a machine learning model to predict Apple's stock price movements using historical financial data. This task evaluates technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and familiarity with financial data by implementing various prediction techniques, including deep learning and regression methods.

The project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze past stock trends and generate forecasts, which can be valuable for investors and analysts.

üìä Applied Models
In this project, Linear Regression and LSTM with Attention Mechanism were applied separately to predict Apple's stock price between January 1, 2008, and February 1, 2025.

## üîç Why Use Both Models?
The goal of using these two distinct approaches is to compare traditional regression techniques with deep learning-based time series forecasting:

  * Linear Regression: A simple yet effective statistical model that captures linear relationships in historical stock data. It serves as a baseline model for comparison.
  * LSTM + Attention Mechanism: A deep learning model designed for sequential data, capable of capturing complex patterns, long-term dependencies, and non-linear trends in stock price movements. The attention mechanism enhances the model‚Äôs focus on the most influential past data points, improving accuracy.
  * 
By evaluating both models separately, this project analyzes their strengths and weaknesses, providing insights into which approach performs better for stock price prediction under different conditions. üöÄ
