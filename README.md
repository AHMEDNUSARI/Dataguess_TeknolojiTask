## üìå Overview
This project was developed as part of an assessment task assigned by Dataguess Teknoloji. The objective is to build a machine learning model to predict Apple's stock price movements using historical financial data. This task evaluates technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and familiarity with financial data by implementing various prediction techniques, including deep learning and regression methods.

The project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze past stock trends and generate forecasts, which can be valuable for investors and analysts.

üìä Applied Models
In this project, Linear Regression and LSTM with Attention Mechanism were applied separately to predict Apple's stock price between January 1, 2008, and February 1, 2025.

## üîç Why Use Both Models?
The goal of using these two distinct approaches is to compare traditional regression techniques with deep learning-based time series forecasting:

  * Linear Regression: A simple yet effective statistical model that captures linear relationships in historical stock data. It serves as a baseline model for comparison.
  * LSTM + Attention Mechanism: A deep learning model designed for sequential data, capable of capturing complex patterns, long-term dependencies, and non-linear trends in stock price movements. The attention mechanism enhances the model‚Äôs focus on the most influential past data points, improving accuracy.
  * 
By evaluating both models separately, this project analyzes their strengths and weaknesses, providing insights into which approach performs better for stock price prediction under different conditions. üöÄ


## üìÇ Repository Overview
This repository contains two types of training processes:

### Training with Apple Stock Price Data:
The models have been trained on Apple's stock price data between January 1, 2008, and February 1, 2025. This training process specifically focuses on predicting stock price movements using both Linear Regression and LSTM with Attention Mechanism.

### Reusable Model Training for Other Datasets:
The repository is designed to allow easy reuse of the models for training on different stock datasets. Users can retrain the models with data from Yahoo Finance stock market data source by following a simple process outlined in the repository. This flexibility makes it easy to apply the models to other stocks or financial data, providing a scalable solution for stock price prediction across different markets.

## üìö Project Reports
This project consists of three main reports that help in understanding the entire process of stock price prediction, from data analysis to model evaluation. These reports provide detailed explanations and visualizations to ensure a clear understanding of how each step contributes to the overall prediction process.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics
For evaluating model performance, we prefer to use the R¬≤ (Coefficient of Determination) metric. Here's why R¬≤ is often more useful than RMSE and MAPE:

  * **R¬≤** measures how well the model's predictions match the actual data. It is a better indicator of the model's explanatory power. A higher R¬≤ indicates that a larger proportion of the variance in stock prices is explained by the model, making it easier to compare different models in terms of how well they fit the data.
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) are often used to assess the accuracy of predictions, but they can be misleading in certain scenarios:
  * **RMSE** gives more weight to large errors, which might distort the model's performance when there are significant outliers in the data.
  * **MAPE** can be biased when actual values are close to zero, leading to misleading results for certain types of data, such as stock prices with very low values at certain times.
Thus, **R¬≤**  is preferred for stock price prediction because it provides a more comprehensive view of the model‚Äôs ability to explain the variability in the stock prices, without being heavily affected by outliers or extreme values.

### Results of Default Training üèÖ

#### 1. **Linear Regression Model** ü§ñ  
   - **RMSE**: 2.9001  
   - **MAPE**: 0.0120  
   - **R¬≤**: 0.9914  

   The **Linear Regression** model achieved impressive performance with an **R¬≤ value** of 0.9914, which means the model explains **99.14%** of the variance in the stock prices. This suggests that Linear Regression has captured the underlying linear relationships between the features and stock price movements effectively. The **RMSE** of 2.9001 indicates a reasonable error level in price prediction, while the **MAPE** value of 0.0120 shows that the model performs well in terms of percentage error.

   The **LSTM with Attention Mechanism** model also performed well with an **R¬≤ value** of 0.9902, explaining **99.02%** of the variance in the stock prices. Although slightly lower than Linear Regression's R¬≤, the **LSTM** model is designed to capture non-linear relationships and temporal dependencies, making it well-suited for time-series data. The **RMSE** of 3.08 is a bit higher than that of the Linear Regression model, indicating a slightly greater error margin, but the LSTM‚Äôs ability to capture complex patterns and sequences gives it an edge in real-world stock price predictions.

## üèÅ Conclusion

In this project, we developed two distinct models‚ÄîLinear Regression and LSTM with Attention Mechanism‚Äîto predict Apple's stock price movement using historical financial data from January 1, 2008, to February 1, 2025. The goal was to compare a traditional regression approach with a deep learning-based model and evaluate their effectiveness in forecasting stock price trends.

The results showed that both models achieved strong performance, with Linear Regression explaining 99.14% of the variance (R¬≤ = 0.9914), while LSTM with Attention Mechanism explained 99.02% (R¬≤ = 0.9902). While the Linear Regression model had slightly better performance in terms of R¬≤ and lower RMSE, the LSTM model's ability to capture complex patterns in sequential data and its superior handling of long-term dependencies demonstrated its strength in more sophisticated forecasting tasks.

The project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of these models in stock price prediction and showed how deep learning techniques, particularly LSTM with attention mechanisms, can offer valuable insights in financial forecasting tasks. Additionally, the flexibility of the repository makes it easy to train the models on other stock datasets, enhancing the applicability of this work to various financial markets.

Ultimately, this project offers valuable insights into model performance evaluation, the importance of feature engineering, and the practical implications of using machine learning in the stock market.
